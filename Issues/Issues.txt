Text file to keep track of issues I have had

1. Time inserted into db as minutes instead of hours
- Orignally had '00' appeneded to the time value to format it to 24hr time
- SQl read this as minutes 
- For example: 1600 --> 00:16:00.0000
- Now with 4 zeros appened - Example: 160000 00> 16:00:00.000
- This is then read as hours over minutes
- Success! 

2. Needed to rewrite all db variables inside a function otherwise sql couldn't function inside the function
- This created long and inneficeint code
- I relaised you could pass the values into the function 
- Added '$DATABASE_HOST, $DATABASE_USER, $DATABASE_PASS, $DATABASE_NAME, $con' as required variables to function that interefaced with the db
- This reduced the lines of code required
- Increased efficiency 

3. CRONTAB not running
- This is needed to create the slots everyday
- Hence the name daemon 
- NOT YET FIXED 

4. Adding 1 day to a date 
- Needed for daemon.php
- Allows multiple days worth of slots to be created
- Currently does not work, no erros but creates 5 days worth of slots all with the same date value

5. For handling forms indside modals
- Paramaters can only be bound to variables within the WHERE clause of the statement
- Must create many functions to do it instead 

6. Minor bugs with modalHandle.php alerts
- Some times alert for details being the same are not shown
- Need to work out later
